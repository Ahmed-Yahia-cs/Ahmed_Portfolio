      <description>Introduction You are working on a self-driving car. As a critical component of this project, youâ€™d like to first build an object detection system. To create the model for this purpose I would be using the Darknet open-source neural network and YOLO object detector. To explain the power of YOLO let&amp;rsquo;s first compare it to a traditional object tracker which utilizes a sliding window.
Traditional Object Detection As you can observe, the window goes over every part of the image until it detects the actual object, in this case, the car.</description>

      <description>Introduction Auto-Complete is a feature that provides relevant suggestions based on input by the user. It works best in domains with a limited number of possible words. There are many applications that is used for such as:
Autocomplete search engine Command line interpreters Source Code Editors. Language models are divided into two types :
Probabilistic methods Neural Network Based But, as it always is, some problems need to be solved first.</description>

      <description>problem definition In this project, I will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals&amp;rsquo; income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. my goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.</description>
